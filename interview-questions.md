## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: it is similar to how conditionals work is javascript because conditional rendering will work only if the conditionals are met. 

2. Object-oriented programming: focuses more on software design around data and not functions and logic. it is important when it comes to large codes which helps if more than one person is working on the same base too. there are 4 concepts which are inheritance, encapsulating, polymorphism, and abstraction. I am not very fimilar with these concepts yet but when getting fimilar with them it will reveal how object-oriented programming truly works.

3. Ruby: it is an object-oriented programming language. can be used for front end and backend web development. Ruby is great when building desktop applications, websites, data processibg services. when adding the functionality of rails framework, makes the job  even easier. now I am intersted in ruby after hearing all that!!

4. Ruby blocks:  blocks of methods that consist of statments and annonymous functions. These blocks allows the developer to save some of the logic and be able to use it later. 

5. Ruby hashes: bunch of unique keys with values. like an array with index, but instead uses an object and instead of object, it is termed as the keys.
